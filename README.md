The purpose of this project was to analyze bikesharing data from NYC to convice investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, IA is a solid business proposal. 

## Overview of Analysis
Bike trip data was analyzed to see what kinds of customers are using the bikesharing service in NYC and what locations and times were more popular.

Most Bikes were checked out for a total of 5 minutes per trip, with a sharp drop in trips after 6 minutes, and fanning out to almost nothing after 1 hour.

The most popular times of the day to checkout a bike for all users were Weekdays between 8a-9a, and between 5p-7p.  Wednesday evenings show a drop in riders.  Weekends showed a different pattern with more riders 11a-1p on Saturdays and 12p-4p on Sundays.

When looking at Customers (one time users) vs. Subscribers (riders who pay a regular fee to access the service) we cfan see that more users are male subscribers who take rides in the beginning and end of the week, with less actiivity on Sunday and Wednesday.
